        <div class="h2">Number of Firearm Laws by State over Time</div>
        <p>
          The graph below shows the number of gun laws in each state over time. For most states, the number of gun laws have increased from 1990 to 2020. 
          The states with the highest number of gun laws are mostly in the coastal regions of the country. The visualization also shows the types of gun laws 
          that are the most popular in the country based on the year. For example, some states have gun laws that prohibit people with a history of alcoholism 
          from acquiring firearms. Some states have gun laws that prohibit those with a criminal record from obtaining guns.
